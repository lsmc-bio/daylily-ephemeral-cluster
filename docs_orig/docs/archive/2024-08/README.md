# Daylily Ephemeral Cluster
[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flsmc-bio%2Fdaylily-ephemeral-cluster%2Fmain%2Fconfig%2Fdaylily_cli_global.yaml&query=%24.daylily.git_ephemeral_cluster_repo_release_tag&label=latest%20release&cacheSeconds=300&color=teal)](https://github.com/lsmc-bio/daylily-ephemeral-cluster/releases) [![Latest tag](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Flsmc-bio%2Fdaylily-ephemeral-cluster%2Fmain%2Fconfig%2Fdaylily_cli_global.yaml&query=%24.daylily.git_ephemeral_cluster_repo_tag&label=latest%20tag&color=pink&cacheSeconds=300)](https://github.com/lsmc-bio/daylily-ephemeral-cluster/tags)

> Infrastructure-as-code for spinning up ephemeral (transient) **AWS ParallelCluster's** that are tuned for bioinformatics and multi-omics analysis, but can run any slurm based or linux derived worflows. The project assembles the networking, storage, authentication, and head-node tooling required to launch, monitor, and tear down self-scaling Slurm clusters with predictable performance and cost transparency. Workflows themselves live in separate repositories, may be in any framework that supports slurm (snakemake, nextflow, cromwell, etc) and can be plugged in on demand and executed on your ephemeral resources.

## Highlights

### Single Command Cluster Creation

```bash
bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region-az <region-az> --config daylily_cluster_config.yaml
```

### Architecture & Features
- **Rapid, reproducible cluster bring-up** built on AWS ParallelCluster with optional PCUI for browser-based terminal and multi-cluster management. 
- **Cost-aware infrastructure** with scripts that inspect spot-market capacity, calculate per-sample spend, and tag workloads for downstream budget reporting. _<small>(using [daylily-omics-analysis](https://github.com/lsmc-bio/daylily-omics-analysis) WGS analysis workflows, can run `fastq`->aligned deduped CRAM->snv+sv VCFs in ~1hr for as little as $5/genome)</small>_
- **Shared FSx for Lustre file system** that mirrors to S3 so hundreds or thousands of spot instances can safely collaborate on the same dataset while persisting results. Final results may then be automagically mirrored back to `s3`. 
- **Pluggable analysis catalog** governed by YAML, enabling one-click cloning of approved pipelines or custom repositories for development work. 
- **Remote data staging & pipeline launch helpers** that transform sample manifests, materialize canned control datasets, and kick off workflows from your workstation into tmux sessions on the head node. 
- **Curated & standardized reference data** for `hg38` and `b37`, and extensible to any arbitrary genome reference datasets via [daylily-omics-references](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-omics-references).
- **Bundled concordance data** via `daylily-omics-references` available to quickly and easily benchmark various pipleines. Datasets include ILMN, PacBio, ONT & Ultima.
- **Region-scoped references bucket** tooling to hydrate FSx with curated reference bundles and optional licensed assets. 

 
## Architecture at a Glance 

Daylily composes several AWS building blocks so you can stand up a full featured HPC environment quickly:

1. **AWS ParallelCluster** AWS ParallelCluster (v3) is the core of the compute fabric, orchestrating spot and on-demand instances into Slurm partitions. 
2. **FSx for Lustre** mounted at `/fsx` with an S3 mirror so reference data, staged inputs, and pipeline outputs survive node turnover. 
3. **Automatic Load Scaling EC2 Instances** with a mix of spot and on-demand instances, tuned for high-throughput genomics workloads.
5. **VPC, subnets, and security groups** sized for high-throughput genomics compute.
6. **Daylily CLI** installed on the head node to provide helpers for data staging, pipeline cloning, and remote execution.
7. **s3 references bucket** with reference genomes, resource bundles, and canned control datasets for benchmarking and concordance.
8. **AWS CloudFormation** templates to orchestrate the above components and manage lifecycle.
9. **AWS CloudWatch** alarms to notify on spot instance interruptions and FSx storage capacity, dashboards to monitor CPU, memory, and network utilization.
10. **Parallel Cluster UI (PCUI)** deployment to provide a web console for job management and interactive shells. 
11. **Project level cost tagging & telemetry** layered on top of AWS Budgets and cost allocation tags to preserve per-sample and per-project visibility. _(experimental: budget enforcement via spot instance termination)_.
12. **Python control plane (`daylily_ec`)** — a 3-layer orchestration library that replaces the legacy Bash monolith with structured preflight validation, YAML rendering, spot-price optimization, cluster creation monitoring, budgets, heartbeat scheduling, and drift detection. Exposed via the `daylily-ec` CLI (built on `cli-core-yo`).

---

## Pluggable Analysis Workflows
The Daylily head node ships with a registry of vetted repositories defined in [`config/daylily_available_repositories.yaml`](config/daylily_available_repositories.yaml). Each entry specifies a friendly name, description, Git endpoints, default revision, and checkout location, allowing operators to:

- Clone approved pipelines (e.g., whole-genome, RNA-seq) in a single command using `day-clone` or standard `git` from the head node.
- Override the registry to test forks, feature branches, or entirely new repositories during development.
- Mix and match pipelines per project without rebuilding the cluster.

Because the compute layer is generic Slurm, any orchestrator that speaks Slurm (Snakemake, Nextflow, Cromwell, custom Bash, etc.) can be scheduled once the repository is present. Daylily’s helper `bin/daylily-run-ephemeral-cluster-remote-tests` demonstrates how to bootstrap a workflow remotely: it clones the configured repository at the requested tag, enters the Daylily environment, and launches a Snakemake target inside a tmux session, making it easy to kick off pipelines from your laptop. 

---

## Reference Data & Canned Controls
High-throughput analyses rely on predictable reference data access. Daylily provides automation to manage reference and control data via [daylily-omics-references](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-omics-references):

- **verify your reference bucket exists**
  ```bash
  daylily-omics-references --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region us-west-2 verify --help
  
  usage: daylily-omics-references verify [-h] --bucket BUCKET [--version {0.7.131c}] [--exclude-hg38] [--exclude-b37] [--exclude-giab]
  options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bucket BUCKET       Name of the bucket to verify
  ```

- **Clone reference bundles** into a region-scoped S3 bucket (`<prefix>-daylily-omics-analysis-<region>`) using
```
daylily-omics-references --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region us-west-2 clone -h

usage: daylily-omics-references clone [-h] --bucket-prefix BUCKET_PREFIX [--region REGION] [--version {0.7.131c}] [--execute] [--exclude-hg38] [--exclude-b37] [--exclude-giab] [--use-acceleration]
                                      [--log-file LOG_FILE]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --bucket-prefix BUCKET_PREFIX
                        Prefix for the new bucket
  --region REGION       AWS region for the new bucket
  --version {0.7.131c}  Reference data version to clone
  --execute             Execute the copy instead of performing a dry-run
  --exclude-hg38        Exclude hg38 references and annotations
  --exclude-b37         Exclude b37 references and annotations
  --exclude-giab        Exclude GIAB concordance reads
  --use-acceleration    Use the S3 accelerate endpoint during copy operations
  --log-file LOG_FILE   Optional path to capture AWS CLI output
```

Example Call

```bash
echo DRYRUN

daylily-omics-references \
    --profile $AWS_PROFILE \
    --region us-west-2 \
      clone
          --bucket-prefix <someprefix> \
          --region us-west-2 \
          --use-acceleration

echo 'Actually run it'

daylily-omics-references \
    --profile $AWS_PROFILE \
    --region us-west-2 \
      clone
          --bucket-prefix <someprefix> \
          --region us-west-2 \
          --use-acceleration \
		  --execute
```


- **Automated mounting of the bucket via FSx** so all compute nodes see `/fsx/data`, `/fsx/resources`, and `/fsx/analysis_results` with low latency. 
- **Stage canned control datasets** when generating pipeline manifests: `bin/daylily-analysis-samples-to-manifest-new.py` accepts concordance directories from S3/HTTP/local paths and copies them alongside samples, while tagging each run as positive or negative control for downstream QC. 

---

## Remote Data Staging & Pipeline Execution
Daylily’s workflow helpers bridge the gap between local manifests and remote execution:

1. Use `bin/daylily-stage-analysis-samples` from your workstation to pick a cluster, upload an `analysis_samples.tsv`, and invoke the head-node staging utility. The script downloads data from S3/HTTP/local paths, merges multi-lane FASTQs, and writes canonical `config/samples.tsv` and `config/units.tsv` files to your chosen staging directory. 
2. The staging utility automatically validates AWS credentials, materializes concordance/control payloads, normalizes metadata, and reports where to copy the generated configs. 
3. When you are ready to launch a workflow, `bin/daylily-run-ephemeral-cluster-remote-tests` can log into the head node, clone the selected pipeline (as configured in the YAML registry), and start the run in a tmux session for detached execution. 

These tools make it straightforward to stage data once, reuse it across pipelines, and keep critical control material co-located with sample inputs.


## Cost Monitoring & Budget Enforcement
Daylily integrates with AWS Budgets and Cost Allocation Tags to provide per-sample and per-project cost visibility:

- **AWS Budgets**: Set up budgets for your projects and receive alerts when you approach your spending limits.
- **Cost Allocation Tags**: Use tags to categorize and track costs associated with specific samples, projects, or workflows.
- **Budget Enforcement**: Optionally enforce budgets by configuring spot instance termination when a budget threshold is reached, helping to prevent unexpected costs.

# Analysis Pipeline Repositories
_plugin process under development, please open an issue or PR to add your own repository_
- Are controlled by the `config/daylily_available_repositories.yaml` file. You may add your own entries to this file, or override it with your own custom file when creating a cluster. To contribute a supported repository back to the mainline, please open a PR.

## Supported Repositories

**[daylily-omics-analysis : comprehensive WGS analysis](https://github.com/daylily-omics/daylily-omics-analysis)**

**[rna-seq-star-deseq2](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/rna-seq-star-deseq2)**

**sarek-nf-core** port of `sarek` WGS pipeline [daylily-sarek](https://github.com/iamh2o/sarek).

## Other

**generic slurm via ubuntu**
> The AWS ParallelCluster created uses `slurm` as the scheduler, so any slurm compatible workflow should work fine. See the AWS ParallelCluster docs for more info.

The AWS Parallel Cluster port of `slurm` has been slightly tweaked in the following ways (but otherwise is a standard slurm install): 
  -  to manage spinning up and down spot instances.
  -  to track and enforce cost budgets by using the `--comment` flag on `sbatch` command.


# Installation -- Quickest Start
_only useful if you have already installed daylily previously and have all of the AWS account configurations in place_

- [Can be found here](docs/quickest_start.md).

# Installation -- Detailed

## AWS 

### Create a `daylily-service`  IAM User
_as the admin user_

From the `Iam -> Users` console, create a new user.

- Allow the user to access the AWS Management Console.
- Select `I want to create an IAM user` _note: the insstructions which follow will probably not work if you create a user with the `Identity Center` option_.
- Specify or autogenerate a p/w, note it down.
- `click next`
- Skip (for now) attaching a group / copying permissions / attaching policies, and `click next`.
- Review the confiirmation page, and click `Create user`.
- On the next page, capture the `Console sign-in URL`, `username`, and `password`. You will need these to log in as the `daylily-service` user.

### Attach Permissions & Policies via an IAM Group (recommended)
_still as the admin user_

Daylily now prefers using an IAM *group* (default: `daylily-ephemeral-cluster`) and
making the `daylily-service` user (and any other operators) members of that group.

#### Permissions

- Navigate to `IAM -> User groups` and create a group named `daylily-ephemeral-cluster`.
- Attach the following AWS managed policies to the **group**:
  - `AmazonQDeveloperAccess`
  - `AmazonEC2SpotFleetAutoscaleRole`
  - `AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole`
- Add the `daylily-service` user to the group.

> Legacy note: attaching policies directly to the user still works, but is discouraged.

Migration (recommended):
- Ensure `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` group exists and has the required policies attached.
- Add `daylily-service` (and any other operators) to the group.
- Optionally remove old direct user attachments once verified:
  - Managed policies: `aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name daylily-service` then `aws iam detach-user-policy ...`
  - Inline policies: `aws iam list-user-policies --user-name daylily-service` then `aws iam delete-user-policy ...`

#### Create Service Linked Role `VERY IMPORTANT`

> If this role is missing, you will get very challenging to debug failures for spot instances to launch, despite the cluster building and headnode running fine.

- Does it exist?
```bash
aws iam list-roles --query "Roles[?RoleName=='AWSServiceRoleForEC2Spot'].RoleName"
```
> if `[]`, then it does not exist.

- Create it if not:
```bash
aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name spot.amazonaws.com
```


#### Inline Policy
__**note:**__ [please consult the parallel cluster docs for fine grained permissions control, the below is a broad approach](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/iam-roles-in-parallelcluster-v3.html).
- Navigate to the `IAM -> User groups` console, click on the `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` group.
- Click on `Add permissions` and select `Create inline policy`.
- Click on the `JSON` bubble button.
- Delete the auto-populated json in the editor window, and paste this json into the editor (replace 3 instances of  <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID> with your new account number, an integer found in the upper right dropdown).

> [The policy template json can be found here](config/aws/daylily-service-cluster-policy.json)

- `click next`
- Name the policy `daylily-service-cluster-policy` (not formally mandatory, but advised to bypass various warnings in future steps), then click `Create policy`.

Alternative (preferred): use the provided admin scripts to create/attach the Daylily policies to your group:
- `bin/admin/daylily_ephemeral_cluster_bootstrap_global.sh --user daylily-service --group daylily-ephemeral-cluster`
- `bin/admin/daylily_ephemeral_cluster_bootstrap_region.sh --region <REGION> --user daylily-service --group daylily-ephemeral-cluster`


### Additional AWS Considerations (also will need _admin_ intervention)
#### Quotas
There are a handful of quotas which will greatly limit (or block) your ability to create and run an ephemeral cluster.  These quotas are set by AWS and you must request increases. The `daylily-cfg=ephemeral-cluster` script will check these quotas for you, and warn if it appears they are too low,  but you should be aware of them and [request increases proactively // these requests have no cost](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home).

**dedicated instances**
_pre region quotas_
- `Running Dedicated r7i Hosts` >= 1 **!!(AWS default is 0) !!**
- `Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) instances` must be >= 9 **!!(AWS default is 5) !!** just to run the headnode, and will need to be increased further for ANY other dedicated instances you (presently)/(will) run.

**spot instances**
_per region quotas_
- `All Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot Instance Requests` must be >= 310 (and preferable >=2958) **!!(AWS default is 5) !!**

**fsx lustre**
_per region quotas_
- should minimally allow creation of a FSX Lustre filesystem with >= 4.8 TB storage, which should be the default.

**other quotas**
May limit you as well, keep an eye on `VPC` & `networking` specifically.


#### Activate Cost Allocation Tags (optional, but strongly suggested)
The cost management built into daylily requires use of budgets and cost allocation tags. Someone with permissions to do so will need to activate these tags in the billing console. *note: if no clusters have yet been created, these tags may not exist to be activeted until the first cluster is running. Activating these tags can happen at any time, it will not block progress on the installation of daylily if this is skipped for now*. See [AWS cost allocation tags](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/tags)

The tags to activate are:
  ```text
  aws-parallelcluster-jobid
  aws-parallelcluster-username
  aws-parallelcluster-project
  aws-parallelcluster-clustername
  aws-parallelcluster-enforce-budget
  ```


#### A Note On Budgets
- The access necesary to *view* budgets is beyond the scope of this config, please work with your admin to set that up. If you are able to create clusters and whatnot, then the budgeting infrastructure should be working.

##### Cost Tags
Cost tags need to be activated for the budget features to work.  HOWEVER, you need to wait for the tags to be used once and sit for a day. Once the tags are visible, you only need to activate them one time per account. The cost tags can be found here: `https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/home?region=us-west-2#/tags`.

```text
aws-parallelcluster-clustername	
aws-parallelcluster-jobid	
aws-parallelcluster-project	
aws-parallelcluster-username	
cost-center	
parallelcluster:cluster-name	
parallelcluster:compute-resource-name	
parallelcluster:node-type	
```

### AWS `daylily-service` User Account
- Login to the AWS console as the `daylily-service` user using the console URL captured above.

#### CLI Credentials
_as the `daylily-service` user_
- Click your username in the upper right, select `Security credentials`, scroll down to `Access keys`, and click `Create access key` (many services will be displaying that they are not available, this is ok).
- Choose 'Command Line Interface (CLI)', check `I understand` and click `Next`.
- Do not tag the key, click `Next`.
**IMPORTANT**: Download the `.csv` file, and store it in a safe place. You will not be able to download it again. This contains your `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` which you will need to configure the AWS CLI. You may also copy this info from the confirmation page.

> You will use the `aws_access_key_id` and `aws_secret_access_key` to configure the AWS CLI on your local machine in a future step.


##### SSH Key Pair(s)
_as the `daylily-service` user_

> Must include `-omics-` in the name!

_key pairs are region specific, be sure you create a key pair in the region you intend to create an ephemeral cluster in_

- Navigate to the `EC2 dashboard`, in the left hand menu under `Network & Security`, click on `Key Pairs`. 
- CLick `Create Key Pair`.
- Give it a name, which must include the string `-omics-analysis-<region>`. So, _ie:_ `username-omics-analysis-us-west-2`. 
- Choose `Key pair type` of `ed25519`.
- Choose `.pem` as the file format.
- Click `Create key pair`.
- The `.pem` file will download, and please move it into your `~/.ssh` dir and give it appropriate permissions. _you may not download this file again, so be sure to store it in a safe place_.

###### Place .pem File & Set Permissions

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

mv ~/Downloads/<yourkey>.pem  ~/.ssh/<yourkey>.pem 
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/<yourkey>.pem
```

## Default Region `us-west-2`
You may run in any region or AZ you wish to try. This said, the majority of testing has been done in AZ's `us-west-2c` & `us-west-2d` (which have consistently been among the most cost effective & available spot markets for the instance types used in the daylily workflows).


---

## Prerequisites (On Your Local Machine) 
Local machine development has been carried out exclusively on a mac using the `zsh` shell. `bash` should work as well (if you have issues with conda w/mac+bash, confirm that after miniconda install and conda init, the correct `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile` files were updated by `conda init`).
 
_suggestion: run things in tmux or screen_

Very good odds this will work on any mac and most Linux distros (ubuntu 22.04 are what the cluster nodes run). Windows, I can't say.

### System Packages
Install with `brew` or `apt-get`:
- `python3`, tested with `3.11.0`
- `git`, tested with `2.46.0`
- `wget`, tested with `1.25.0`
- `tmux` (optional, but suggested)
- `emacs` (optional, I guess, but I'm not sure how to live without it)

#### Check if your prereq's meet the min versions required by running this script
```bash
./bin/check_prereq_sw.sh 
```

### AWS CLI Configuration
#### Opt 2
Create the aws cli files and directories manually.

```bash
mkdir ~/.aws
chmod 700 ~/.aws

touch ~/.aws/credentials
chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials

touch ~/.aws/config
chmod 600 ~/.aws/config
```

Edit `~/.aws/config`, which should look like:

```ini
[default]
region = us-west-2
output = json

[daylily-service]
region = us-west-2
output = json

```

Edit `~/.aws/credentials`, and add your deets, which should look like:
```yaml
[default]
aws_access_key_id = <default-ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <default-SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
region = <REGION>


[daylily-service]
aws_access_key_id = <daylily-service-ACCESS_KEY>
aws_secret_access_key = <daylily-service-SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
region = <REGION>
```

- The `default` profile is used for general AWS CLI commands, `daylily-service` can be the same as default, best practice to not lean on default, but be explicit with the intended AWS_PROFILE used.

> To automatically use a profile other than `default`, set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable to the profile name you wish to use. _ie:_ `export AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service`



### Clone stable release of `daylily` Git Repository

```bash
git clone -b $(yq -r '.daylily.git_tag' "config/daylily/daylily_cli_global.yaml") https://github.com/lsmc-bio/daylily-ephemeral-cluster.git  # or, if you have set ssh keys with github and intend to make changes:  git clone git@github.com:lsmc-bio/daylily-ephemeral-cluster.git
cd daylily-ephemeral-cluster
```

#### stable `daylily` release

This repo is cloned to your working environment, and cloned again each time a cluster is created and again for each analysis set executed on the cluster.  The version is pinned to a tagged release so that all of these clones work from the same released version.  This is accomplished by all clone operations pulling the release via:

```bash
echo "Pinned release: "$(yq -r '.daylily.git_tag' "config/daylily_cli_global.yaml")
```

Further, when attemtping to activate an environment on an ephemeral cluster with `dy-a`, this will check to verify that the cluster deployment was created with the matching tag, and throw an error if a mismatch is detected. You can also find the tag logged in the cluster yaml created in `~/.config/daylily/<yourclustername>.yaml`.


### Install Miniconda (homebrew is not advised)
_tested with conda version **`24.11.1`**_

Install with:
```bash
./bin/install_miniconda
```
- open a new terminal/shell, and conda should be available: `conda -v`.

### Install DAY-EC Environment
_from `daylily` root dir_

```bash

./bin/init_dayec

conda activate DAY-EC

# CLI commands from ./bin are now on your PATH.
# Re-run this after pulling updates if needed.
# (init_dayec performs an editable pip install when run from a repo checkout)

# DAY-EC should now be active... did it work?
colr  'did it work?' 0,100,255 255,100,0

```

# Ephemeral Cluster Creation

## Clone Reference Bucket (only needs to be done once per region, or anytime it is missing)
_`daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` will fail if the expected reference bucket is not detected in the region you run in._
- _DRY RUN_ clone :
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=<profile>
daylily-omics-references \
    --profile $AWS_PROFILE \
    --region us-west-2 \
    clone \
    --bucket <yourprefix>-daylily \
    --use-acceleration \
    --region us-west-2
```

- _LIVE RUN_ clone (this will take one to several hours depending on acceleration, if copying w/in or cross regions, etc):
```bash
daylily-omics-references \
    --profile $AWS_PROFILE \
    --region us-west-2 \
    clone \
    --bucket <yourprefix>-daylily \
    --use-acceleration \
    --region us-west-2 \
    --execute
```
  - note: if the command fails b/c, try again w/out `--acceleration` and see if this works. You will probably need to go delete the newly creaetd bucket first.

## [daylily-references-public](#daylily-references-public-bucket-contents) Reference Bucket

- The `daylily-references-public` bucket is preconfigured with all the necessary reference data to run the various pipelines, as well as including GIAB reads for automated concordance. 
- This bucket will need to be cloned to a new bucket with the name `<YOURPREFIX>-omics-analysis-<REGION>`, one for each region you intend to run in.
- These S3 buckets are tightly coupled to the `Fsx lustre` filesystems (which allows 1000s of concurrnet spot instances to read/write to the shared filesystem, making reference and data management both easier and highly performant). 
- [Continue for more on this topic,,,](#s3-reference-bucket--fsx-filesystem).
- This will cost you ~$23 to clone w/in `us-west-2`, up to $110 across regions. _(one time, per region, cost)_ 
- The bust will cost ~$14.50/mo to keep hot in `us-west-2`. It is not advised, but you may opt to remove unused reference data to reduce the monthly cost footprint by up to 65%. _(monthly ongoing cost)_

### Clone `daylily-references-public` to YOURPREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION

_from your local machine, in the daylily git repo root_

> You may add/remove/update your copy of the refernces bucket as you find necessary.

- `YOURPREFIX` will be used as the bucket name prefix. Please keep it short. The new bucket name will be `YOURPREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION` and created in the region you specify. You may name the buckets in other ways, but this will block you from using the `daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` script, which is largely why you're here.
- Cloning it will take 1 to many hours.
  
**Use the following script**

_running in a tmux/screen session is advised as the copy may take 1-many hours_

```bash
conda activate DAY-EC
# help
./bin/create_daylily_omics_analysis_s3.sh -h

export AWS_PROFILE=<your_profile>
BUCKET_PREFIX=<your_prefix>
REGION=us-west-2

# dryrun

The helper script is a thin wrapper around the
[`daylily-omics-references`](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-omics-references)
CLI (version `0.1.0`). Activating the `DAY-EC` conda environment installs the
dependency automatically. You can also invoke the CLI directly once the
`DAY-EC` environment is active (the editable install makes it available from
any working directory):

```bash
daylily-omics-references --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region $REGION \
  clone --bucket-prefix $BUCKET_PREFIX --version 0.7.131c --execute
```

> You may visit the `S3` console to confirm the bucket is being cloned as expected. The copy (if w/in `us-west-2` should take ~1hr, much longer across AZs.

## Generate Analysis Cost Estimates per Availability Zone 

_from your local machine, in the daylily git repo root_

You may choose any AZ to build and run an ephemeral cluster in (assuming resources both exist and can be requisitioned in the AZ). Run the following command to scan the spot markets in the AZ's you are interested in assessing (reference buckets do not need to exist in the regions you scan, but to ultimately run there, a reference bucket is required):

_this command will take ~5min to complete, and much longer if you expand to all possible AZs, run with `--help` for all flags_

```bash

conda activate DAY-EC
export AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service
REGION=us-west-2          
OUT_TSV=./init_daylily_cluster.tsv

./bin/check_current_spot_market_by_zones.py -o $OUT_TSV --profile $AWS_PROFILE   
```

## Create An Ephemeral Cluster
_from your local machine, in the daylily git repo root_

Once you have selected an AZ && have a reference bucket ready in the region this AZ exists in, you are ready to proceed to creating an ephemeral cluster.

The following script will check a variety of required resources, attempt to create some if missing and then prompt you to select various options which will all be used to create a new parallel cluster yaml config, which in turn is used to create the cluster via `StackFormation`. [The template yaml file can be checked out here](config/day_cluster/prod_cluster.yaml).

#### Using the Python control plane (recommended)

```bash
conda activate DAY-EC
export AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service
REGION_AZ=us-west-2c

# Full cluster creation
python -m daylily_ec create --region-az $REGION_AZ --profile $AWS_PROFILE

# With --pass-on-warn to continue past non-critical warnings
python -m daylily_ec create --region-az $REGION_AZ --profile $AWS_PROFILE --pass-on-warn

# Run preflight validation only (no cluster creation)
python -m daylily_ec preflight --region-az $REGION_AZ --profile $AWS_PROFILE
```

The thin Bash wrapper at `bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` now delegates to the Python control plane automatically. See the [CLI Reference](../../README.md#daylily-ec-cli-reference) in the main README.

#### Using the Bash wrapper (backward compatible)

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service
REGION_AZ=us-west-2c
./bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster --region-az $REGION_AZ --profile $AWS_PROFILE

# And to bypass the non-critical warnings (which is fine, not all can be resolved )
./bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster --region-az $REGION_AZ --profile $AWS_PROFILE --pass-on-warn
```

> The original Bash monolith is preserved at `bin/legacy/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster.bash` for reference.

During the run the script invokes the `daylily-omics-references` CLI to
validate the selected reference bucket, preventing misconfigured buckets from
reaching the cluster provisioning phase.

#### Automatic headnode configuration

After a successful cluster creation, the Python control plane automatically configures the headnode:

- Generates an SSH key pair on the headnode (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`)
- Clones the `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` repository to `~/projects/`
- Installs Miniconda and creates the `DAY-EC` conda environment
- Installs `day-clone` and deploys config files to `~/.config/daylily/`
- Sources `dyinit` in `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile`

This step is **non-fatal** — if any sub-step fails, the cluster remains usable and a warning is logged. You can re-run headnode configuration manually at any time with:

```bash
./bin/daylily-cfg-headnode
```

### Provide defaults with `DAY_EX_CFG`

Configuration for every prompt in `bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` lives in a user-managed YAML file. Copy the template
`config/daylily_ephemeral_cluster_template.yaml` to a writable location (for example `config/daylily_ephemeral_cluster.yaml`) and
set the environment variable `DAY_EX_CFG` to point at it:

```bash
cp config/daylily_ephemeral_cluster_template.yaml config/daylily_ephemeral_cluster.yaml
export DAY_EX_CFG=$PWD/config/daylily_ephemeral_cluster.yaml
```

- Each key in the template corresponds to information collected by the script. Provide a concrete value to skip the prompt or
  leave the value set to `PROMPTUSER` to request the information interactively.
- When the script encounters an invalid configured value (for example, an ARN that no longer exists), the error is logged and
  the prompt is shown so you can supply a working value on the fly.
- If a prompt queries AWS for options and only one choice is returned (key pair, S3 bucket, subnets, IAM policy, etc.), the
  script automatically selects that single option and notes the selection in the terminal.
- After a cluster is created, the script saves a timestamped snapshot of the resolved configuration (including any values you
  entered interactively) in `~/.config/daylily/`. Any invalid configuration values are recorded in the snapshot with an
  `+ERROR` suffix so they can be fixed before the next run.
- Remember to adjust the `max_count_*I` settings to match your available spot-instance quotas to avoid deadlocks during
  provisioning.

**The gist of the flow of the script is as follows:**

- Your aws credentials will be auto-detected and used to query appropriate resources to select from to proceed. You will be prompted to:

- (_one per-region_) select the full path to your $HOME/.ssh/<mykey>.pem (from detected .pem files)
  
- (_one per-region_) select the `s3` bucket you created and seeded, options presented will be any with names ending in `-omics-analysis`. The script now verifies the bucket with the `daylily-omics-references` CLI and will halt if required data are missing. Or you may select `1` and manually enter a s3 url.
  
- (_one per-region-az_) select the `Public Subnet ID` created when the cloudstack formation script was run earlier. **if none are detected, this will be auto-created for you via stack formation**

- (_one per-region-az_) select the `Private Subnet ID` created when the cloudstack formation script was run earlier.from the cloudformation stack output. **if none are detected, this will be auto-created for you via stack formation**

- (_one per-aws-account_) select the `Policy ARN` created when the cloudstack formation script was run earlier. **if none are detected, this will be auto-created for you via stack formation**

- (_one unique name per region_)enter a name to asisgn your new ephemeral cluster (ie: `<myorg>-omics-analysis`)

- (_one per-aws account_) You will be prompted to enter info to create a `daylily-global` budget (allowed user-strings: `daylily-service`, alert email: `your@email`, budget amount: `100`)

- (_one per unique cluster name_) You will be prompted to enter info to create a `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` budget (allowed user-strings: `daylily-service`, alert email: `your@email`, budget amount: `100`)

- Enforce budgets? (default is no, _yes is not fully tested_)

- Choose the cloudstack formation `yaml` template  (default is `prod_cluster.yaml`)

- Choose the FSx size (default is 4.8TB)

- Opt to store detailed logs or not (default is no)

- Choose if you wish to AUTO-DELETE the root EBS volumes on cluster termination (default is NO *be sure to clean these up if you keep this as no*)

- Choose if you wish to RETAIN the FSx filesystem on cluster termination (default is YES *be sure to clean these up if you keep this as yes*)

The script will take all of the info entered and proceed to:

- Run a process will run to poll and populate maximum spot prices for the instance types used in the cluster.

- A `CLUSTERNAME_cluster.yaml` and `CLUSTERNAME_init_template_<timestamp>.yaml` file are created in `~/.config/daylily/`; the initialization template captures the collected values (replacing the legacy `_cluster_init_vals.txt`).

- First, a dryrun cluster creation is attempted.  If successful, creation proceeds.  If unsuccessful, the process will terminate.

- The ephemeral cluster creation will begin and a monitoring script will watch for its completion. **this can take from 20m to an hour to complete**, depending on the region, size of Fsx requested, S3 size, etc.  There is a max timeout set in the cluster config yaml of 1hr, which will cause a failure if the cluster is not up in that time. 

The terminal will block, a status message will slowly scroll by, and after ~20m, if successful, the headnode config will begin (you may be prompted to select the cluster to config if there are multiple in the AZ.  The headnode confiig will setup a few final bits, and then run a few tests (you should see a few magenta success bars during this process).


If all is well, you will see the following message:

```text
You can now SSH into the head node with the following command:
ssh -i /Users/daylily/.ssh/omics-analysis-b.pem ubuntu@52.24.138.65
Once logged in, as the 'ubuntu' user, run the following commands:
  cd ~/projects/daylily
  source dyinit
  source dyinit  --project PROJECT
  dy-a local hg38 # the other option being b37

  export DAY_CONTAINERIZED=false # or true to use pre-built container of all analysis envs. false will create each conda env as needed

  dy-r help
 
"Would you like to start building various caches needed to run jobs? [y/n]"

```

- (optional), you may select `y` or `n` to begin building the cached environments on the cluster. The caches will be automatically created if missing whenever a job is submitted. They should only need to be created _once_ per ephemeral cluster (the compute nodes all share the caches w/the headnode). The build can take 15-30m the first time.

- You are ready to roll.


> During cluster creation, and especially if you need to debug a failure, please go to the `CloudFormation` console and look at the `CLUSTER-NAME` stack.  The `Events` tab will give you a good idea of what is happening, and the `Outputs` tab will give you the IP of the headnode, and the `Resources` tab will give you the ARN of the FSx filesystem, which you can use to look at the FSx console to see the status of the filesystem creation.

### Run Remote Slurm Tests On Headnode (using `daylily-omics-analysis`)

```bash
./bin/daylily-run-ephemeral-cluster-remote-tests $pem_file $region $AWS_PROFILE
```

A successful test will look like this:
  
  > ![](docs/images/daylily_remote_test_success.png)


### Review Clusters
You may confirm the cluster creation was successful with the following command (alternatively, use the PCUI console).

```bash
pcluster list-clusters --region $REGION
```

### Confirm The Headnode Is Configured

[See the instructions here](#first-time-logging-into-head-node) to confirm the headnode is configured and ready to run the daylily pipeline.

This is intended as a tool for not only managing costs, but as a very important metric to track in assessing various tools utility moving ahead (are the costs of a tool worth the value of the data produced by it, and how does this tool compare with others in the same class?)


## Regulating Usage via Budgets (experimental)
During setup of each ephemeral cluster, each cluster can be configured to enforce budgets. Meaning, job submission will be blocked if the budget specifiecd has been exceeded.
  

## OF HOT & IDLE CLUSTER ( ~$1.68 / hr )
For default configuration, once running, the hourly cost will be ~ **$1.68** (_note:_ the cluster is intended to be up only when in use, not kept hot and inactive).
The cost drivers are:

1. `r7i.2xlarge` on-demand headnode = `$0.57 / hr`.
2. `fsx` filesystem = `$1.11 / hr` (for 4.8TB, which is the default size for daylily. You do not pay by usage, but by size requested). 
3.  No other EC2 or storage (beyond the s3 storage used for the ref bucket and your sample data storage) costs are incurred.

## OF RUNNING CLUSTER ( >= $1.20 / hr )
There is the idle hourly costs, plus...

### Spot instances ( ~$1.20 - $3.50 / hr per 192vcpu instance )
For v192 spots, the cost is generally $1 to $3 per hour _(if you are discriminating in your AZ selection, the cost should be closer to $1/hr)_.

- You pay for spot instances as they spin up and until they are shut down (which all happens automatically). The max spot price per resource group limits the max costs (as does the max number of instances allowed per group, and your quotas).

### Data transfer, during analysis ( ~$0.00 )
There are no anticipated or observed costs in runnin the default daylily pipeline, as all data is already located in the same region as the cluster. The cost to reflect data from Fsx back to S3 is effectively $0.

### Data transfer, staging and moving off cluster ( ~$0.00 to > $0.00/hr )
Depending on your data management strategy, these costs will be zero or more than zero.

- You can use  Fsx to bounce results back to the mounted S3 bucket, then move the results elsewhre, or move them from the cluster to another bucket (the former I know has no impact on performance, the latter might interfere with network latency?).

### Storage, during analysis ( ~$0.00 )
- You are paying for the fsx filesystem, which are represented in the idle cluster hourly cost. There are no costs beyond this for storage.
- *HOWEVER*, you are responsible for sizing the Fsx filesystem for your workload, and to be on top of moving data off of it as analysis completes. Fsx is not intended as a long term storage location, but is very much a high performance scratch space.


## OF DELETED CLUSTER -- compute and Fsx ( ~$0.00 )
If its not being used, there is no cost incurred.

## OF REFERENCE DATA in S3 ( $14.50 / month )
- The reference bucket will cost ~$14.50/mo to keep available in `us-west-2`, and one will be needed in any AZ you intend to run in. 
- You should not store your sample or analysis data here long term.
-   ONETIME per region reference bucket cloning costs $10-$27.

## OF SAMPLE / READ DATA in S3 ( $0.00 to $A LOT / month )
- I argue that it is unecessary to store `fastq` files once bams are (properly) created, as the bam can reconstitute the fastq. So, the cost of storing fastqs beyond initial analysis, should be `$0.00`.

## OF RESULTS DATA in S3 ( $Varies, are you storing BAM or CRAM, vcf.gz or gvcf.gz? )

I suggest:

- CRAM (which is ~1/3 the size of BAM, costs correspondingly less in storage and transfer costs).
- gvcf.gz, which are bigger than vcf.gz, but contain more information, and are more useful for future analysis. _note, bcf and vcf.gz sizes are effectively the same and do not justify the overhad of managing the additional format IMO._

# PCUI (technically optional, but you will be missing out)
_*it will be easier to first create your first cluster so you have the appropriate VPC/subnets pre-built*_

[Install instructions here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install-pcui-v3.html#install-pcui-steps-v3), launch it using the public subnet created in your cluster, and the vpcID this public net belongs to. These go in the `ImageBuilderVpcId` and `ImageBuilderSubnetId` respectively.

You should be sure to enable SSM which allows remote access to the nodes from the PCUI console. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started-ssm-user-permissions.html

## Install Steps
Use a preconfigured template in the region you have built a cluster in, [they can be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/install-pcui-v3.html#install-pcui-steps-v3).
  
You will need to enter the following (all other params may be left as default):

- `Stack name`: parallelcluster-ui
- `Admin's Email`: your email ( a confirmation email will be sent to this address with the p/w for the UI, and can not be re-set if lost ).
- `ImageBuilderVpcId`: the *vpcID of the public subnet* created in your cluster creation, visit the VPC console and look for a name like `daylily-cs-<REGION-AZ>` #AZ is digested to text, us-west-2d becomes us-west-twod
- `ImageBuilderSubnetId`: the *subnetID of the public subnet* created in your cluster creation, visit the VPC console to find this (possibly navigate from the EC2 headnode to this).
- Check the 2 acknowledgement boxes, and click `Create Stack`.

This will boot you to cloudformation, and will take ~10m to complete.  Once complete, you will receive an email with the password to the PCUI console. 

To find the PCUI url, visit the `Outputs` tab of the `parallelcluster-ui` stack in the cloudformation console, the url for `ParallelClusterUIUrl` is the one you should use. You use the entered email and the password emailed to login the first time.

> The PCUI stuff is not required, but very VERY awesome.

> **When you use the SSM web browser `shell` via PCUI, you will need to run the following command: `sudo su - ubuntu` to move to the user setup to run the various pipelines.**

### Adding `inline policies` To The PCUI IAM Roles To Allow Access To Parallel Cluster Ref Buckets
Go to the `IAM Dashboard`, and under roles, search for the role `ParallelClusterUIUserRole-*` and the role `ParallelClusterLambdaRole-*`. For each, add an in line json policy as follows (_you will need to enumerate all reference buckets you wish to be able to edit with PCUI_). Name it something like `pcui-additional-s3-access`. *you may be restricted to only editing clusters w/in the same region the PCUI was started even with these changes*

```json
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:ListBucket",
				"s3:GetBucketLocation"
			],

			]
		},
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"s3:GetObject",
				"s3:PutObject"
			],
			"Resource": [
				"arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME-USWEST2/*",
				"arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME-EUCENTRAL1/*",
				"arn:aws:s3:::YOURBUCKETNAME-APSOUTH1/*"
			]
		},
    {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
            "fsx:*"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
    }
	]
}
```

# From The Ephemeral Cluster Headnode

## Confirm Headnode Configuration Is Complete (using the `daylily-omics-analysis` repo)

**Is `daylily` CLI Available & Working**

```bash
cd ~/projects/daylily-omics-analysis
. dyinit # inisitalizes the daylily cli
dy-a local hg38 # activates the local config using reference hg38, the other build available is b37

```

> if `. dyinit` works, but `dy-a local` fails, try `dy-b BUILD`

This should produce a magenta `WORKFLOW SUCCESS` message and `RETURN CODE: 0` at the end of the output.  If so, you are set. If not, see the next section.

### (if) Headnode Confiugration Incomplete

If there is no `~/projects/daylily` directory, or the `dyinit` command is not found, the headnode configuration is incomplete. 

**Attempt To Complete Headnode Configuration**
From your remote terminal that you created the cluster with, run the following commands to complete the headnode configuration.

```bash
conda activate DAY-EC

./bin/daylily-cfg-headnode $PATH_TO_PEM $CLUSTER_AWS_REGION $AWS_PROFILE

# This script now installs Miniconda and initializes the DAY-EC environment on the
# headnode after cloning `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` to `~/projects/`. If you need
# to re-run that setup manually from the headnode, run:
#   cd ~/projects/daylily-ephemeral-cluster
#   ./bin/install_miniconda && ./bin/init_dayec
```

> If the problem persists, ssh into the headnode, and attempt to run the commands as the ubuntu user which are being attempted by the `daylily-cfg-headnode` script.

### Confirm Headnode /fsx/ Directory Structure

**Confirm `/fsx/` directories are present**

```bash
ls -lth /fsx/

total 130K
drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 33K Sep 26 09:22 environments
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 33K Sep 26 08:58 data
drwxrwxrwx 5 root root 33K Sep 26 08:35 analysis_results
drwxrwxrwx 3 root root 33K Sep 26 08:35 resources
```

### Run A Local Test Workflow

#### `day-clone`

The `day-clone` script will be available to the ubuntu user on the headnode. This script wraps up the fetching and creating of various approved runnable workflows/pipelines.

## Stage Sample Data & Build `config/samples.tsv` and `config/units.tsv`

The sample staging helper that previously lived in `daylily-omics-analysis` now ships with this repository. Use it to turn an
`analysis_samples.tsv` file into staged FASTQs under `/fsx/staged_sample_data` and the Snakemake-style config tables (`samples.tsv`
and `units.tsv`) that the workflows consume. A template TSV is available at
[`etc/analysis_samples_template.tsv`](etc/analysis_samples_template.tsv).

### Run Directly On The Head Node

```bash
cd ~/projects/daylily-ephemeral-cluster
./bin/daylily-stage-analysis-samples-headnode /path/to/analysis_samples.tsv
# optionally override the stage target
./bin/daylily-stage-analysis-samples-headnode /path/to/analysis_samples.tsv /fsx/custom_dir
```

The helper defaults to `/fsx/staged_sample_data` and writes `samples.tsv` and `units.tsv` to that directory after staging.

### Launch Staging From Your Laptop

```bash
./bin/daylily-stage-samples-from-local-to-headnode --profile <aws_profile> --region <aws_region> \
    --pem ~/.ssh/<your-key>.pem --cluster <cluster-name> /path/to/analysis_samples.tsv
```

When values such as the region, cluster name, or PEM file are omitted the script will prompt for them. The workflow is:

1. Upload the TSV to the selected head node.
2. Run `daylily-stage-analysis-samples-headnode` remotely so data are staged into `/fsx/staged_sample_data/<timestamp>/`.
3. Download `samples.tsv` and `units.tsv` back next to the local TSV (disable with `--no-download`).

This preserves the head node staging behaviour while allowing the process to be initiated during cluster provisioning.

### Clone & Launch the Workflow From Your Laptop

After staging samples you can kick off the default `daylily-omics-analysis` workflow from the same machine that created the cluster:

```bash
./bin/daylily-run-omics-analysis-headnode --profile <aws_profile> --region <aws_region> \
    --pem ~/.ssh/<your-key>.pem --cluster <cluster-name>
```

The helper locates the most recent staging run (or a directory you specify with `--stage-dir`), clones the analysis repository via `day-clone`, copies the generated `config/samples.tsv` and `config/units.tsv`, and launches `dy-r` inside a tmux session on the head node. Attach with `tmux attach -t daylily-omics-analysis` after logging in via SSH to monitor progress. Use options such as `--target`, `--jobs`, or `--dy-command` to tailor the run.

## Slurm Monitoring

### Monitor Slurm Submitted Jobs

Once jobs begin to be submitted, you can monitor from another shell on the headnode(or any compute node) with:

```bash
# The compute fleet, only nodes in state 'up' are running spots. 'idle' are defined pools of potential spots not bid on yet.
sinfo
PARTITION AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
i8*          up   infinite     12  idle~ i8-dy-gb64-[1-12]
i32          up   infinite     24  idle~ i32-dy-gb64-[1-8],i32-dy-gb128-[1-8],i32-dy-gb256-[1-8]
i64          up   infinite     16  idle~ i64-dy-gb256-[1-8],i64-dy-gb512-[1-8]

                 1      i192 D-strobe   ubuntu PD       0:00      1 (BeginTime)
# ST = PD is pending
# ST = CF is a spot has been instantiated and is being configured
# PD and CF sometimes toggle as the spot is configured and then begins running jobs.

# ST = R is running


# Also helpful
watch squeue

# also for the headnode
glances
```


### SSH Into Compute Nodes

You can not access compute nodes directly, but can access them via the head node. From the head node, you can determine if there are running compute nodes with `squeue`, and use the node names to ssh into them.

```bash
ssh i192-dy-gb384-1
```


### Delete Cluster

**warning**: this will delete all resources created for the ephemeral cluster, importantly, including the fsx filesystem. You must export any analysis results created in `/fsx/analysis_results` from the `fsx` filesystem  back to `s3` before deleting the cluster. 

- During cluster config, you will choose if Fsx and the EBS volumes auto-delete with cluster deletion. If you disable auto-deletion, these idle volumes can begin to cost a lot, so keep an eye on this if you opt for retaining on deletion.

### Export `fsx` Analysis Results Back To S3

#### Facilitated

Run:

```bash
./bin/daylily-export-fsx-to-s3 <cluster_name> <region> <export_path:analysis_results>
```

- export_path should be `analysis_results` or a subdirectory of `analysis_results/*` to export successfully. 
- The script will run, and report status until complete. If interrupted, the export will not be halted. 
- You can visit the FSX console, and go to the Fsx filesystem details page to monitor the export status in the data repository tab.


#### Via `FSX` Console

- Go to the 'fsx' AWS console and select the filesystem for your cluster.
- Under the `Data Repositories` tab, select the `fsx` filesystem and click `Export to S3`. Export can only currently be carried out back to the same s3 which was mounted to the fsx filesystem. 
- Specify the export path as `analysis_results` (or be more specific to an `analysis_results/subdir`), the path you enter is named relative to the mountpoint of the fsx filesystem on the cluster head and compute nodes, which is `/fsx/`. Start the export. This can take 10+ min.  When complete, confirm the data is now visible in the s3 bucket which was exported to. Once you confirm the export was successful, you can delete the cluster (which will delete the fsx filesystem).

#### Delete The Cluster
Deleting the cluster will delete all resources created for the ephemeral cluster, including the fsx filesystem if not explicitly set to be saved during creation. You must export any analysis results created in `/fsx/analysis_results` from the `fsx` filesystem back to `s3` before deleting the cluster.

> One exception when deleting the ephemeral cluster is the cloudwatch logs created for the cluster will persist after deletion for the number of days specified in the pcluster config. You may delete these manually if you wish to do so via the cloudwatch log group dashboard.

##### via `bin/daylily-delete-ephemeral-cluster`
This helper script will guide you through deleting the cluster, and will confirm you have exported data from the fsx filesystem before proceeding.

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=<daylily-service-profile>./bin/daylily-delete-ephemeral-cluster # then enter the region and cluster name
```

##### via pcluster CLI
_note: this will not modify/delete the s3 bucket mounted to the fsx filesystem, nor will it delete the policyARN, or private/public subnets used to config the ephemeral cluster._

**the headnode `/root` volume and the fsx filesystem will be deleted if not explicitly flagged to be saved -- be sure you have exported Fsx->S3 before deleting the cluster**

```bash
pcluster delete-cluster-instances -n <cluster-name> --region us-west-2
pcluster delete-cluster -n <cluster-name> --region us-west-2
```

- You can monitor the status of the cluster deletion using `pcluster list-clusters --region us-west-2` and/or `pcluster describe-cluster -n <cluster-name> --region us-west-2`. Deletion can take ~10min depending on the complexity of resources created and fsx filesystem size.

##### via PCUI
- Navigate to the `Clusters` tab of the PCUI console.
- Select the cluster you wish to delete, and click the `Delete` button.

# Other Monitoring Tools

## PCUI (Parallel Cluster User Interface)
... For real, use it!

## Quick SSH Into Headnode
(also, can be done via pcui)

`bin/daylily-ssh-into-headnode`

_alias it for your shell:_ `alias goday="source ~/projects/daylily-ephemeral-cluster/bin/daylily-ssh-into-headnode"`


---

## AWS Cloudwatch

- The AWS Cloudwatch console can be used to monitor the cluster, and the resources it is using.  This is a good place to monitor the health of the cluster, and in particular the slurm and pcluster logs for the headnode and compute fleet.
- Navigate to your `cloudwatch` console, then select `dashboards` and there will be a dashboard named for the name you used for the cluster. Follow this link (be sure you are in the `us-west-2` region) to see the logs and metrics for the cluster.
- Reports are not automaticaly created for spot instances, but you may extend this base report as you like.  This dashboard is automatically created by `pcluster` for each new cluster you create (and will be deleted when the cluster is deleted).

# And There Is More

## S3 Reference Bucket & Fsx Filesystem

### PREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION Reference Bucket

Daylily relies on a variety of pre-built reference data and resources to run. These are stored in the `daylily-references-public` bucket. You will need to clone this bucket to a new bucket in your account, once per region you intend to operate in.  

> This is a design choice based on leveraging the `FSX` filesystem to mount the data to the cluster nodes. Reference data in this S3 bucket are auto-mounted an available to the head and all compute nodes (*Fsx supports 10's of thousands of concurrent connections*), further, as analysis completes on the cluster, you can choose to reflect data back to this bucket (and then stage elsewhere). Having these references pre-arranged aids in reproducibility and allows for the cluster to be spun up and down with negligible time required to move / create refernce data. 

> BONUS: the 7 giab google brain 30x ILMN read sets are included with the bucket to standardize benchmarking and concordance testing.

> You may add / edit (not advised) / remove data (say, if you never need one of the builds, or don't wish to use the GIAB reads) to suit your needs.

#### Reference Bucket Metrics

*Onetime* cost of between ~$27 to ~$108 per region to create bucket.

*monthly S3 standard* cost of ~$14/month to continue hosting it.

- Size: 617.2GB, and contains 599 files.
- Source bucket region: `us-west-2`
- Cost to store S3 (standard: $14.20/month, IA: $7.72/month, Glacier: $2.47 to $0.61/month)
- Data transfer costs to clone source bucket
  - within us-west-2: ~$3.40
  - to other regions: ~$58.00
- Accelerated transfer is used for the largest files, and adds ~$24.00 w/in `us-west-2` and ~$50 across regions.
- Cloning w/in `us-west-2` will take ~2hr, and to other regions ~7hrs.
- Moving data between this bucket and the FSX filesystem and back is not charged by size, but by number of objects, at a cost of `$0.005 per 1,000 PUT`. The cost to move 599 objecsts back and forth once to Fsx is `$0.0025`(you do pay for Fsx _when it is running, which is only when you choose to run analysus_).

### The `YOURPREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION` s3 Bucket

- Your new bucket name needs to end in `-omics-analysis-REGION` and be unique to your account.
- One bucket must be created per `REGION` you intend to run in.
- The reference data version is currently `0.7`, and will be replicated correctly using the script below.
- The total size of the bucket will be 779.1GB, and the cost of standard S3 storage will be ~$30/mo.
- Copying the daylily-references-public bucket will take ~7hrs using the script below.

#### daylily-references-public Bucket Contents

- `hg38` and `b37` reference data files (including supporting tool specific files).
- 7 google-brain ~`30x` Illunina 2x150 `fastq.gz` files for all 7 GIAB samples (`HG001,HG002,HG003,HG004,HG005,HG006,HG007`).
- snv and sv truth sets (`v4.2.1`) for all 7 GIAB samples in both `b37` and `hg38`.
- A handful of pre-built conda environments and docker images (for demonstration purposes, you may choose to add to your own instance of this bucket to save on re-building envs on new eclusters).
- A handful of scripts and config necessary for the ephemeral cluster to run.

_note:_ you can choose to eliminate the data for `b37` or `hg38` to save on storage costs. In addition, you may choose to eliminate the GIAB fastq files if you do not intend to run concordance or benchmarking tests (which is advised against as this framework was developed explicitly to facilitate these types of comparisons in an ongoing way).

# Fsx Filesystem

Are region specific, and may only intereact with `S3` buckets in the same region as the filesystem. There are region specific quotas to be aware of.

- Fsx filesystems are extraordinarily fast, massively scallable (both in IO operations as well as number of connections supported -- you will be hard pressed to stress this thing out until you have 10s of thousands of concurrent connected instances).  It is also a pay-to-play product, and is only cost effective to run while in active use.
- Daylily uses a `scratch` type instance, which auto-mounts the region specific `s3://PREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION/data` directory to the fsx filesystem as `/fsx/data`.  `/fsx` is available to the head node and all compute nodes.  
- When you delete a cluster, the attached `Fsx Lustre` filesystem will be deleted as well.  
- > **BE SURE YOU REFLECT ANALYSIS REUSLTS BACK TO S3 BEFORE DELETING YOUR EPHEMERAL CLUSTER** ... do this via the Fsx dashboard and create a data export task to the same s3 bucket you used to seed the fsx filesystem ( you will probably wish to define exporting `analysis_results`, which will export back to `s3://PREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION/FSX-export-DATETIME/` everything in `/fsx/analysis_results` to this new FSX-export directory.  **do not export the entire `/fsx` mount, this is not tested and might try to duplicate your reference data as well!** ).  This can take 10+ min to complete, and you can monitor the progress in the fsx dashboard & delete your cluster once the export is complete.
- Fsx can only mount one s3 bucket at a time, the analysis_results data moved back to S3 via the export should be moved again to a final destination (w/in the same region ideally) for longer term storage.  
- All of this handling of data is amendable to being automated, and if someone would like to add a cluster delete check which blocks deletion if there is unexported data still on /fsx, that would be awesome.
- Further, you may write to any path in `/fsx` from any instance it is mounted to, except `/fsx/data` which is read only and will only update if data mounted from the `s3://PREFIX-omics-analysis-REGION/data` is added/deleted/updated (not advised).

## Fsx Directory Structure

The following directories are created and accessible via `/fsx` on the headnode and compute nodes.

```text

/fsx/
├── analysis_results
│   ├── cromwell_executions  ## in development
│   ├── daylily   ## deprecated
│   └── ubuntu  ## <<<< run all analyses here <<<<

# In Progress // Future Development



## Using Data From Benchmarking Experiments, Complete The Comprehensive Cost Caclulator

- Rough draft script is running already, with best guesses for things like compute time per-x coverage, etc.

## Update Analysis Pipeline To Run With Snakemake v8.*

- A branch has been started for this work, which is reasonably straightforward. Tasks include:
-  The AWS parallel cluster slurm snakemake executor, [pcluster-slurm](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/snakemake-executor-plugin-pcluster-slurm)  is written, but needs some additional features and to be tested at scale.
-  ✅ Migrated from the legacy `analysis_manifest.csv` to the Snakemake `v8.*` `config/samples/units` format (which is much cleaner than the original manifest).
-  The actual workflow files should need very little tweaking.

## Cromwell & WDL's

- Running Cromwell WDL's is in early stages, and preliminary & still lightly documented work can be found [here](config/CROMWELL/immuno/workflow.sh) ( using the https://github.com/wustl-oncology as starting workflows ).

# General Components Overview

> Before getting into the cool informatics business going on, there is a boatload of complex ops systems running to manage EC2 spot instances, navigate spot markets, as well as mechanisms to monitor and observe all aspects of this framework. [AWS ParallelCluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html) is the glue holding everything together, and deserves special thanks.

## Some Bioinformatics Bits, Big Picture

### The DAG For 1 Sample Running Through The `BWA-MEM2ert+Doppelmark+Deepvariant+Manta+TIDDIT+Dysgu+Svaba+QCforDays` Pipeline

NOTE: *each* node in the below DAG is run as a self-contained job. Each job/n
ode/rule is distributed to a suitable EC2 spot(or on demand if you prefer) instance to run. Each node is a packaged/containerized unit of work. This dag represents jobs running across sometimes thousands of instances at a time. Slurm and Snakemake manage all of the scaling, teardown, scheduling, recovery and general orchestration: cherry on top: killer observability & per project resource cost reporting and budget controls!
   
   ![](docs/images/assets/ks_rg.png)
   
   - The above is actually a compressed view of the jobs managed for a sample moving through this pipeline. This view is of the dag which properly reflects parallelized jobs.

# Known Issues

## _Fsx Mount Times Out During Headnode Creation & Causes Pcluster `build-cluster` To Fail_

If the `S3` bucket mounted to the FSX filesystem is too large (the default bucket is close to too large), this can cause Fsx to fail to create in time for pcluster, and pcluster time out fails.  The wait time for pcluster is configured to be much longer than default, but this can still be a difficult to identify reason for cluster creation failure. Probability for failure increases with S3 bucket size, and also if the imported directories are being changed during pcluster creation. Try again, try with a longer timeount, and try with a smaller bucket (ie: remove one of the human reference build data sets, or move to a different location in the bucket not imported by Fsx)

## Cloudstack Formation Fails When Creating Clusters In >1 AZ A Region (must be manually sorted ATM)

The command `bin/init_cloudstackformation.sh ./config/day_cluster/pcluster_env.yml "$res_prefix" "$region_az" "$region" $AWS_PROFILE` does not yet gracefully handle being run >1x per region.  The yaml can be edited to create the correct scoped resources for running in >1 AZ in a region (this all works fine when running in 1AZ in >1 regions), or you can manually create the pub/private subnets, etc for running in multiple AZs in a region. The fix is not difficult, but is not yet automated.


# Compliance / Data Security

All tools involved in `daylily-ephemeral-cluster` can be managed in such a way to satisfy various clinical comlicance requirements. This is largely in your hands. AWS Parallel Cluster is as secure or insecure as you set it up to be. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/v2/ug/security-compliance-validation.html. The main point here is it *can* in my experience be managed in compliance heavy settings, no problem.

 # Super Helpful Stuff

## Cluster Quick Build Approaches
Assuming you have created a cluster with ``bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region-az <region-az>`, it will leave 3 artifact files in `~/.config/daylily/`:

- `<cluster_name>_cli_cfg_<datetime>.yaml` # used by daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster script
- `<cluster_name>_template.yaml`
- `<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml` # used by pcluster and PCUI

### (highly recommended) via `daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` script
Using `<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml` 

> You should edit the cluster name in the config file to be unique before re-using it.

```bash
bin/daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster --profile $AWS_PROFILE --region-az <region-az> --config ~/.config/daylily/<cluster_name>_cli_cfg_<datetime>.yaml
```

### (less reccomended) via `pcluster` directly with `<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml` 

> !!! This will not create budgets or sns monitoring....

```bash
pcuster create-cluster -n <cluster_name> --region <region> --cluster-template ~/.config/daylily/<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml
```

### (less recommended) via `PCUI`
#### From a running cluster
- Navigate to the `PCUI` console, select the region you wish to operate in. Choose 'create new cluster' and choose from a running or stopped cluster.

#### From a cluster config file `<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml` 
- Navigate to the `PCUI` console, select the region you wish to operate in. Choose 'create new cluster' and choose 'from cluster config file', and upload the `<cluster_name>_cluster.yaml` file.
 

## Cluster Tagged Resources Report
To create a terminal report of all currently tagged AWS resources with `cluster name`.

![Cluster tagged resources report](docs/images/cluster_tagged_resources.png)

 ### One Time, Create Policy
 ```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=YOURADMINUSERPROFILE
aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name DaylilyCostRead \
  --policy-document file://config/aws/generate_cluster_report.json
 ```

 ### Per Group / User membership (recommended)
 ```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=YOURADMINUSERPROFILE

GROUP_NAME=daylily-ephemeral-cluster
USER_NAME=daylily-service
ACCOUNT_ID=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)

aws iam create-group --group-name "$GROUP_NAME" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true
aws iam attach-group-policy \
  --group-name "$GROUP_NAME" \
  --policy-arn "arn:aws:iam::${ACCOUNT_ID}:policy/DaylilyCostRead"
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name "$USER_NAME" --group-name "$GROUP_NAME"
 ```
 
## STAGING DATA

### From Your Local Machine To The Headnode
- Must be run from your local machine used to create clusters.
- Copies files from local paths or accessible s3 buckets to the headnode, and stages them into `/fsx/data/staged_sample_data/<timestamp>/`. Generates `samples.tsv` and `units.tsv` in the staging directory.
- These files will appear in your S3 bucket as well under /data/staged_sample_data/<timestamp>/.
  - ... meaning they will appear in any cluster mounting this reference bucket.
  - The directory with these files should be moved to a non mounted dir in the bucket when not acively being used.
- *NOTE* This script does not concatenate lane fastqs like the headnode version of this script.
```bash
bin/daylily-stage-samples-from-local-to-headnode --region us-west-2  --profile daylily-service --debug  --reference-bucket  s3://daylily-dayoa-omics-analysis-us-west-2 etc/analysis_samples_template.tsv # replace <BUCKET> with your bucket name
```


### From The Headnode
- Must be run from the headnode of the cluster.
- Requires that you run `aws configure --profile <aws_profile>` first to set up aws credentials on the headnode.
- Copies files from local paths or accessible s3 buckets to the headnode, and stages them into `/fsx/staged_sample_data/<timestamp>/`. Generates `samples.tsv` and `units.tsv` in the staging directory.
- Lane fastqs are concatenated into combined fastqs if desired.
- These files are in the /fsx scratch space and will not be saved once the cluster is deleted, be sure to export them back to s3 if you wish to retain them.
  
```bash
bin/daylily-stage-samples-from-headnode --region us-west-2  --profile daylily-service --debug  --reference-bucket  daylily-dayoa-omics-analysis-us-west-2 etc/analysis_samples_template.tsv # replace <BUCKET> with your bucket name
```


## Monitor Cluster Costs
Costs can be delayed by up to 24hrs from AWS.


### Via Cost Explorer Budgets
Navigate to the `Budgets` section of the `AWS Cost Management` console.  You will see a budget named for your cluster. 

![](docs/images/cost_budget.png)

### Command Line Report
Pulls by tagged resources with the `cluster name` tag key. Good for looking for orphaned resources, or just getting a quick report of costs. 

```bash
AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service-lsmc bin/generate-report-of-aws-tagged-resources.py -h
usage: generate-report-of-aws-tagged-resources.py [-h] [--tag-key TAG_KEY] [--since SINCE] [--until UNTIL]
                                                  [--metric {AmortizedCost,UnblendedCost,NetAmortizedCost,NetUnblendedCost}] [--top-n TOP_N]
                                                  [--budget-name BUDGET_NAME] [--profile PROFILE] [--region REGION]
                                                  [--show-services SHOW_SERVICES] [--exclude-services EXCLUDE_SERVICES] [--only-show-active]
```

...

`AWS_PROFILE=daylily-service-lsmc bin/generate-report-of-aws-tagged-resources.py --only-show-active`

![](docs/images/cost_report.png)


### PCUI
![](docs/images/cost_pcui.png)

### SNS Notifications (cluster heartbeat - experimental)
You can monitor the health of your cluster via SNS notifications.  These are created automatically when you create a cluster via the `daylily-create-ephemeral-cluster` script.  You can subscribe to the topic via email, sms, or other methods.  You will receive notifications while pricey tagged resources remain active (most importantly, FSx filesystems and EBS volumes which can be set not to delete upon cluster termination, and which can become expensive to sit idle).
